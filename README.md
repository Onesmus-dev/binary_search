# Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of linear search and binary search algorithms in Python. Each algorithm is timed using a custom decorator to measure its execution time.

## Files

- `search.py`: Contains the implementations of the linear and binary search algorithms with timing functionality.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Onesmus-dev/binary_search.git
